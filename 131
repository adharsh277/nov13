# python operators

# 1..Arthematic operators
print(5+2)  # addition

print(5-2)  # subtraction

print(5*2)  # product

print(5/2)  # division

print(5 % 2)  # modulas..i.e. remainder

print(15//4)  # gives only the integer part of the quotient

print(5**2)  # act as power operator that is 5^2

# 2..Assignment operators

a = 5  # assiging the value 5 to varibale a
print(a)
a += 3  # it means same as a=a+3
print(a)
a -= 2  # it means same as a=a-2
print(a)
a *= 5  # it means same as a=a*5
print(a)
a /= 6  # it means same as a=a/5
print(a)
a %= 3  # it means same as a=a%3
print(a)
a **= 3  # it means same as a=a**3
print(a)
a //= 4  # it means same as a=a//4
print(a)

# 3..Comparision operators

print(3 == 4)  # equality check

print(3 != 4)  # not equality check

print(3 > 4)  # greater then check

print(3 < 4)  # less then check

print(5 >= 6)  # greater then equality check

print(5 <= 6)  # less then equality check\

# 4..Logical operators
x = 2
print(x < 5 and x < 8)  # return true only if both the statements are true
print(x > 3 and x > 1)

print(x > 2 or x > 1)  # return true if atleast one of the conditions are true
print(x > 2 or x > 3)

print(not (x > 2 or x > 3))  # it returns the reversed result(vice versa)

# 5..identity operators
a = [10, 20]
b = [10, 20]
c = a
# returns true if both the variables are the same object pointing to a same memory location
print(a is c)
# it will return false because only object is same but the memory location is different here
print(b is a)

print(a == b)  # it will only check only for the object value
print(a is not b)  # returns true if both variables are not the same object
print(a is not c)
print(a != b)  # it returns false as a is equal to b

# 6..membership operator

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 50]
print(2 in a)  # in->returns true if the sequence is present in the object
# not in-> returns true if the sequence is NOT present in the object
print(3 not in a)

# PRSCTICE
a = 67
b = 98
if b > a:
    print('lionel messi will lift fifa world cup 2022')
# elif
a = 55
b = 55
if b > a:
    print('b is greaetr than everything')
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
    # else
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")

a = 200
b = 33

    print('a is greater than b')
# 235
a = 2

    print("Both conditions are True")
# 214
a = 200

if a > b or a > c:
    print("At least one of the conditions is True")
# 2367
x = 41

if x > 10:
    print("Above ten,")
    if x > 20:
        print("and also above 20!")
    else:
        print("but not above 20.")
